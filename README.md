# google_analytics_case_study

I completed the Google Analytics course on Coursera in the summer of 2021. The attached code and presentation were the products I created as part of the culminating case study.

The files you will find include the R code I wrote to perform my analysis and a pdf of the slide deck I created to share results.

Enjoy, and please share any feedback you have on the code.
